# Room Allocator Website

## How teachers should use this site

1. Prepare two files:
   - **Pupils Excel** (use the template `pupils_choices_template.xlsx`)
   - **Rooms CSV** (use the template `rooms_list_template.csv`)

2. Upload both files on the website.

3. Click **Allocate**.

4. Download the final Excel table of room allocations.

### Rules applied
- Boys and girls are placed in separate rooms.
- Tries to ensure every pupil has at least one of their chosen friends.
- Tries to avoid single pupils in a room.
- If it is not possible to satisfy all rules, the app will display a **warning** and show the closest possible allocation.

### Notes
- The templates in this repository are **empty** â€” no real pupil data is stored here.
- Teachers should fill in the templates with pupil names and their room preferences before using the site.
